# Active Context

## Current Work Status
**Phase**: Architecture and Design Complete  
**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for implementation planning

## Recent Accomplishments

### Architecture Design Completed
- ✅ **System architecture diagram** with AWS components and data flow
- ✅ **Mermaid diagrams** showing component relationships and sequence flows
- ✅ **UI mockups** for all 4 pages with ASCII art layouts
- ✅ **API contracts** with complete TypeScript interfaces and endpoints
- ✅ **Conflict resolution** between UI, API, and architecture specifications

### Key Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Single-record ExperimentResults**: Nested JSON structure instead of multiple timepoint records
2. **Client-side templates**: Frontend-only form prefilling, no backend template system
3. **Auto-complete experiments**: No manual start/stop controls, immediate processing
4. **Simplified dashboard**: Removed complex filtering, kept basic functionality for demo
5. **Event-driven analysis**: DynamoDB streams trigger DiD analysis after results generation

### Documentation Created
- **architecture-diagram.md**: Complete system overview with visual diagrams
- **ui-mockups.md**: All 4 pages with Dropbox Design-style layouts
- **api-contracts.md**: Full API specification with TypeScript interfaces
- **.clinerules**: Development patterns and constraints (38 rules)

## Current Technical State

### Data Model Finalized
```typescript
// Core entities with single-record pattern
ExperimentDefinition: Basic metadata (id, name, metrics, dates)
ExperimentResult: Complete dataset (nested metrics with time series)
ExperimentAnalysis: DiD results + economic impact calculations  
MetricValue: Economic value configuration (dollars per unit)
```

### API Endpoints Defined
```
POST   /experiments              # Create new experiment
GET    /experiments              # List all with summary stats
GET    /experiments/{id}         # Get experiment details  
GET    /experiments/{id}/results # Get results + analysis
GET    /metric-values           # Get all metric configurations
PUT    /metric-values/{id}      # Update metric value
POST   /metric-values           # Create new metric
```

### UI Pages Specified
1. **Create Experiment**: Template buttons + custom form
2. **Experiment Dashboard**: Simple list with summary statistics
3. **Results Detail**: Charts, analysis, economic impact
4. **Metric Management**: Configure dollar values per metric

## Next Steps

### Implementation Planning
1. **Initialize Nx monorepo** with proper workspace configuration
2. **Set up shared package** with TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
3. **Create infrastructure package** with CDK stacks for AWS resources
4. **Build Lambda functions** (API handler, results generator, analysis processor)
5. **Develop React frontend** with TanStack Router and CSS Modules
6. **Deploy to AWS** and validate end-to-end functionality

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Workspace setup**: Initialize Nx with proper project structure
2. **Shared types**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all data models
3. **Infrastructure foundation**: Basic CDK setup with DynamoDB tables
4. **API skeleton**: Basic Lambda function structure with health checks

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **DynamoDB stream timing**: Ensure analysis triggers properly after results completion
- **Economic calculations**: Implement DiD analysis algorithm correctly
- **Data simulation**: Generate realistic time-series data for demonstrations
- **Type safety**: Maintain consistency between frontend and backend types

### Design Decisions Pending
- **Template content**: Define specific experiment templates and their default values
- **Chart implementation**: Choose charting library compatible with CSS Modules
- **Error handling**: Define user-friendly error messages and recovery flows
- **Loading states**: Design progressive loading for async operations

## Team Context
- **Mode**: Architect mode for design phase
- **Focus**: System design and specification completion
- **Approach**: Document-first architecture with conflict resolution
- **Quality**: Emphasis on consistency between UI, API, and architecture

## Memory Bank Notes
This represents the completion of the architecture and design phase. All major system components are specified and conflicts have been resolved. The project is ready to transition from design to implementation, starting with Nx workspace initialization and shared type definitions.
