## Work In Progress

### ðŸ”„ Implementation Planning
**Status**: Next Phase  
**Priority**: High

#### Workspace Setup
- [ ] **Initialize Nx monorepo** with proper configuration
- [ ] **Configure project.json** files for all packages
- [ ] **Set up build targets** and dependency relationships
- [ ] **Configure TypeScript** across workspace

#### Package Structure
- [ ] **Create shared package** with types and schemas
- [ ] **Set up infrastructure package** with CDK code
- [ ] **Initialize Lambda packages** (api-handler, results-generator, analysis-processor)
- [ ] **Create frontend package** with React and TanStack Router

## Upcoming Work

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Phase
**Estimated Start**: Immediate  
**Priority**: High

#### Infrastructure Development
- [ ] **DynamoDB tables** with proper indexes and streams
- [ ] **Lambda function setup** with NodejsFunction primitives
- [ ] **API Gateway configuration** with CORS and routing
- [ ] **S3 bucket** and CloudFront distribution for frontend

#### Backend Development
- [ ] **Main API Lambda** with all 7 endpoints
- [ ] **Results Generator** with time-series simulation
- [ ] **Analysis Processor** with DiD calculations
- [ ] **Health check endpoints** for monitoring

#### Frontend Development
- [ ] **React components** for all 4 pages
- [ ] **TanStack Router setup** with proper navigation
- [ ] **CSS Modules** with Dropbox Design styling
- [ ] **API client** for backend communication

#### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] **Unit tests** for core business logic
- [ ] **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- [ ] **CDK deployment** to AWS environment
- [ ] **End-to-end validation** of complete workflow

### ðŸ“Š Data & Analytics
**Priority**: Medium

#### Data Simulation
- [ ] **Realistic time-series generation** for different experiment types
- [ ] **Statistical variation** to make data believable
- [ ] **Economic impact calculation** using metric values
- [ ] **DiD analysis implementation** with proper statistical methods

#### Visualizations
- [ ] **Chart library selection** compatible with CSS Modules
- [ ] **Time-series charts** for treatment vs control comparison
- [ ] **Summary statistics** displays with economic focus
- [ ] **Export functionality** for sharing results

## Known Issues & Risks

### Technical Risks
- **DynamoDB stream timing**: Need to ensure analysis triggers at right moment
- **Type consistency**: Maintain sync between shared types and actual usage
- **AWS SDK bundling**: Ensure proper bundling without external marking
- **Build artifact validation**: Must verify build outputs after changes

### Design Risks
- **Template content**: Need to define realistic experiment templates
- **Economic calculations**: DiD algorithm must be statistically sound
- **User experience**: Balance simplicity with professional appearance
- **Data believability**: Simulated data must look realistic for demos

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Build success**: All packages build without errors
- **Deployment success**: CDK deploys cleanly to AWS
- **Type safety**: No TypeScript errors across workspace
- **API functionality**: All endpoints return correct responses

### User Experience Metrics
- **Workflow completion**: Users can create experiments and view results
- **Professional appearance**: UI meets Dropbox Design standards
- **Economic clarity**: Dollar impact is clear and believable
- **Performance**: Pages load quickly and operate smoothly

## Notes
The architecture and design phase is complete with all major conflicts resolved. The project is well-positioned for implementation with clear specifications and consistent patterns across all components. Focus should now shift to workspace setup and shared type definitions as the foundation for development.
