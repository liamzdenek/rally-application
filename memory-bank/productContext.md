# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to quantify the economic impact of UX/UI improvements. Design teams need concrete evidence that their work drives business value, but traditional analytics don't clearly connect design changes to revenue outcomes.

## Solution Approach
RallyUXR bridges the gap between design decisions and business metrics by:

1. **Structured Experiment Tracking**: Systematically monitor UX experiments with defined metrics
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply DiD methodology to isolate the impact of design changes
3. **Economic Translation**: Convert metric improvements into dollar values using configurable rates
4. **Professional Reporting**: Present results in executive-friendly formats with clear ROI calculations

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User: UX Researchers & Product Managers
- **Quick Experiment Setup**: Template-based experiment creation for common scenarios
- **Clear Economic Story**: Immediately understand dollar impact of design changes
- **Professional Reporting**: Generate shareable reports for stakeholders
- **Metric Management**: Configure and maintain economic value mappings

### Key User Workflows

#### 1. Create Experiment
- Choose from template library (Button Color, Checkout Flow, etc.) or create custom
- Select relevant metrics (conversion rate, revenue per user, engagement)
- Define experiment timeline and expected outcome
- Submit for automatic processing

#### 2. View Results
- Access comprehensive analysis with statistical confidence
- See economic impact breakdown by metric
- Review time-series visualizations showing treatment vs control
- Export data for presentations and reports

#### 3. Manage Metric Values
- Configure dollar value per unit increase for each metric
- Track historical changes to metric valuations
- Maintain consistency across experiments
